<h1>Winter Quarter Projects, 2023</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

These projects were completed through my second quarter at Seattle University. With some understanding of coding experience, it became much easier, but each new professor brought more challenges and new ways to do things. We used makefiles in this quarter and began diving into classes. We emulated games but also made a Reverse Polish Notation calculator.
